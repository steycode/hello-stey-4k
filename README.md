Project to introduce kotlin, Spring Boot, and more to build Stey tech stacks, to new comers.

For job applicants
 1. Clone the project
 2. Change default serialization of dates (java.util.Date and Instant) to Unix timestamp (in seconds)
 3. Add extra deserialization of dates format "YYYY-MM-DD" to Instant with time set at 00:00. A value of "2020-02-25" should be deserialized to "2020-02-25T00:00:00Z". Should work for request body and query params. Other formats of deserialization to Instant should still work.
 4. Add new serializer and deserializer in JSON for **Pageable** and **Sort** of Spring Data. Default jackson serialization is not appropriate for use.
 5. Change global default **Pageable** values (size, page, param name, etc) for RestController methods parameters
 6. Issue a pull request for review
